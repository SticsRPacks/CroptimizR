# CroptimizR: A Package to estimate parameters of Crop Models

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/187874725.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/187874725)

The purpose of CroptimizR is to provide functions for estimating crop model parameters from observations of their simulated variables, a process often referred to as calibration. For that, it offers a generic framework for linking crop models with up-to-date and ad-hoc algorithms, as well as a choice of goodness-of-fit criteria and additional features adapted to the problem of crop model calibration. It facilitates the comparison of different types of methods on different models. It is used in this context in the [AgMIP Calibration project](https://agmip.org/crop-model-calibration-3/) on a dozen of crop models.

The [Get started page](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/CroptimizR.html) describes the main concepts and features of the package and details how to connect its own crop model to CroptimizR.

The list of functions accessible to the users is provided in the [Reference](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/reference/index.html) tab.

If you want to be notified when a new release of this package is made, you can tick the Releases box in the "Watch / Unwatch => Custom" menu at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR).

## Installation

Before installing the package, it is recommended to update all already installed R packages. This can be done using the command `update.packages()` or clicking on the Update button of the Packages panel of Rstudio. 

The latest released version of the package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/CroptimizR@*release")
```
Or using the lightweight [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/CroptimizR@*release")
```

## Examples

* Simple introductory examples of parameter estimation using CroptimizR on complex crop models are provided in vignettes, using the STICS model [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_simple_case.html) and the ApsimX model [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/ApsimX_parameter_estimation_simple_case.html)
 
* A more complex example, showing simultaneous estimation of specific and varietal plant parameters is available  [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_Specific_and_Varietal.html).

* An example demonstrating the application of a parameter selection algorithm can be found [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_selection.html).

* An example using the DREAM-zs Bayesian algorithm is detailed [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_DREAM.html).

* An example illustrating the AgMIP calibration workflow is shown [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/AgMIP_Calibration_Protocol.html).

See [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/reference/estim_param.html) for a detailed description of the input and output arguments of the `estim_param` function, the core function for parameter estimation (or type `? estim_param` in an R console after installing and loading the CroptimizR package). See also the `run_protocol_agmip` function for applying the AgMIP calibration workflow in a streamlined way.
