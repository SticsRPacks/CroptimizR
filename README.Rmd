# CroptimizR: An R package for parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis for Crop Models

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## Overview

This package is dedicated to Probabilistic Uncertainty analysis, Sensitivity analysis and Parameter estimation for crop models.

It is under intensive development, so you can fill an issue or request a feature [here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR/issues) at any time. The list of functions accessible to the users is provided in this [webpage](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/reference/index.html).

For the moment, only parameter estimation functions have been developped. The ([`estim_param`](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/reference/estim_param.html)) function can be used to perform parameter estimation using multi-start Nelder-Meade simplexe minimization of [different least square criterion](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/reference/ls_criterion.html). 

Functionnalities for simultaneous estimation of varietal and specific parameters are provided (see [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_Specific_and_Varietal.html) for an example).

CroptimizR is designed to be crop model generic: all the functionalities can be used on any crop model for which an R wrapper can be implemented. For the moment, R wrappers are available for Stics and APSIM crop models (see [SticsOnR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR) and [ApsimOnR](https://github.com/hol430/ApsimOnR)). A wrapper for SiriusQuality is under development.

Guidelines for developping a wrapper for your favourite crop model are given in the following [vignette](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Designing_a_model_wrapper.html).

Planned features, installation and examples of use are described in the following sections.


## Planned features

### Probabilistic Uncertainty analysis

To evaluate the uncertainty of crop models outputs resulting from the propagation of the uncertainty of their inputs for a given set of simulated situations.

Main features:

* inputs’ uncertainties will be described by the user using (usual) probability distributions or by users’ given sample (or a mixed of both depending on the parameters), 

* facilities will be provided to describe distributions of **groups of parameters** (soils, weather, farming practices, initial conditions) using map labelling techniques (i.e. distributions of identifiers of soil / weather / … files) ,

* description of **joint probability distributions** including dependencies between parameters’ uncertainties should be provided,

* tools for **probabilistic modeling** could be provided (e.g. to generate new values, from a sample given by the user, by assessing the probability distribution it is sampled from),

* several methods wil be available to generate the numerical design of experiment: **full-factorial design, random sampling using different methods (LHS, Quasi-Monte Carlo …)**,

Results provided: numerical (moments, quantiles …) and graphical (**histograms / density plots / boxplots / violins, correlation plots, time series of quantiles for dynamic variables …**) description of the sample of output variables obtained. 

### Sensitivity analysis

To assess how the uncertainty of crop models outputs can be allocated to the uncertainty of their inputs /  to describe the effects of the variations of crop models inputs on their outputs, for a given set of simulated situations.

Main features:

* inputs’ uncertainties will be described as for uncertainty analysis functionality,

* several methods should be provided to cope with diverse users’ needs: 

  * **Screening methods** (e.g. Morris) for a quick assessment of the effect of numerous inputs, 

  * **Importance measures**: correlation coefficients, Variance-based methods (Sobol, EFAST, PCE...), Moment independent methods, for a more precise assessment of their impact, 

  * **Multivariate Sensitivity Analysis** methods to cope with temporal outputs, 

  * **Graphical methods**: scatter plots, response surface, cobweb plots, …

  * Variants of these methods adapted to **dependent inputs** should be provided … (at least analysis per group of parameters) 

Results provided: numerical and graphical representations (bar plots / pie charts / temporal plots of sensitivity indices …) of the indices depending on the method

### Parameter estimation / model calibration

To estimate the values of a selection of crop models parameters (soil, plant …) from observations of a set of their output variables, 

Main features:

* procedures for **automatic selection of the parameters to estimate** from a given list (e.g. forward selection using criterions such as AIC, MSEP …)

* facilities to describe and perform **calibration in different steps**: different parameters are estimated from different observed situations and variables at each step using different **forcings** (lai, phenological stages) and using the parameters values estimated at the preceding steps,

* facilities to describe and take into account **prior information and constraints** (e.g. inequality constraints) on estimated parameters and output variables,

*	**facilities to transform model outputs** in case observations does not corresponds to the crop model outputs

*	**different types of criterion** to compare simulations and observations (i.e. of objective function to minimize) and different ways of combining these criteria for several variables: e.g. classical ordinary least-square, weighted-least-square, concentrated-likelihood for automatic estimation of error variances, criterion that take into account error correlations … (see e.g. Wallach et al., 2011)

*	different estimation methods:**frequentists (e.g. Nelder-Meade Simplex), Bayesians (e.g. multi-chain MCMC, SIR), global optimization (Evolutionnary Algorithms, GLUE), multi-objective methods,	…**

* methods for evaluating the **predictive performance** of the calibrated model (cross validation …)

Results provided: 

*	estimated values and uncertainties of estimated parameters, 

*	specific diagnostics depending on the estimation method used,

*	evaluation of the predictive performance of the calibrated model, 

*	description of the calibration process followed.


## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/CroptimizR")
```
Or using the lightweight [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/CroptimizR")
```
The package is tested routinely to pass all [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) tests using Travis-CI (linux) and AppVeyor (Windows), but it is not yet released to the CRAN servers: CroptimizR is still under development and users are not yet widespread enough to bother CRAN people and use their free server time.

## Examples

A simple introductory example of model calibration using the Stics model is given in this [vignette](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_simple_case.html).

A more complex one with simultaneous estimation of specific and varietal parameters is given  [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_Specific_and_Varietal.html).

An example using the ApsimX model is detailed [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/ApsimX_parameter_estimation_simple_case.html).

See [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/reference/estim_param.html) for a detailed description of the input and output arguments of the estim_param function (or type "? estim_param" in an R console after having installed and loaded the CroptimizR package).
