\title{Plot Bias² and MSE evolution by calibration step as diagnostic of the AgMIP Protocol}
\usage{
plot_stats_evolution(stats_per_step, steps_by_var, step_levels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{stats_per_step}{A data.frame containing at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{step} (character or factor): calibration step
\item \code{variable} (character): name of the variable
\item \code{Bias2} (numeric): Bias² statistic
\item \code{MSE} (numeric): MSE statistic
}}

\item{steps_by_var}{A named character vector associating each variable
(\code{names(steps_by_var)}) to the name of the step in which it is (last) used
(\code{steps_by_var[variable]}).}

\item{step_levels}{(optional) Character vector giving the global order
of steps. If not provided, the order of appearance in \code{stats_per_step$step}
is used.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with one facet per variable, ordered according to
their step of use.
}
\description{
Create diagnostic plots showing the evolution of Bias² and MSE statistics
across calibration steps for one or several variables. For each variable,
the curve is drawn with attenuated color before the calibration step where
it is first used, then in normal color from this step onwards. Panels are
ordered by the step of first use of each variable.
