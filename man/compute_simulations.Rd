\usage{
compute_simulations(
  model_function,
  model_options,
  param_values,
  situation,
  var_to_simulate,
  obs_list,
  transform_sim = NULL,
  transform_var = NULL,
  sit_var_dates_mask = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_function}{Crop Model wrapper function to use.}

\item{model_options}{List of options for the Crop Model wrapper (see help of
the Crop Model wrapper function used).}

\item{param_values}{Named vector or tibble, value(s) of the parameters to
pass to the model wrapper}

\item{situation}{(optional) List of situations to take into account within obs_list.
situation = NULL means that all situations in obs_list will be used.}

\item{var_to_simulate}{(optional) List of variables for which the model wrapper must return
results.
By default the wrapper is asked to simulate only the observed variables. However,
it may be useful to simulate also other variables, typically when transform_sim
and/or transform_obs functions are used. Note however that it is
active only if the model_function used handles this argument.
If it is the case, and if the obs_var argument is provided, then the list of observations
used will be restricted to the list of variables given in the obs_var argument,
plus the ones possibly computed by the transform_sim function.}

\item{obs_list}{List of observed values to use for parameter estimation.
A \verb{named list} (names = situations names) of data.frame containing
one column named Date with the dates (Date or POSIXct format) of the different observations
and one column per observed variables with either the measured values or NA, if
the variable is not observed at the given date.
See details section for more information on the list of observations actually
used during the parameter estimation process.}

\item{transform_sim}{User function for transforming simulations before each criterion
evaluation  (optional), see details section for more information.}

\item{transform_var}{Named vector of functions to apply both on simulated and
observed variables. \code{transform_var=c(var1=log, var2=sqrt)} will for example
apply log-transformation on simulated and observed values of variable var1,
and square-root transformation on values of variable var2.}
}
\value{
List of model and transformed results, in the cropr_simulation format.
